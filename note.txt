{% if ans is defined and ans|length >0 %} 
this jinj2 statement if used to deal with numpy arrays 
checking if ans is defined and length greater than zero 

remember to save the standardScalar model

rememeber to convert the values from html to float and dont use variable names
that can conflict with functions (open)
